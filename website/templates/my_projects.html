            <h3><a href="" target="_blank">SHOE STORE APP</a></h3>
        <p>this React application was a so much fun to build!</p><br/>
        <p>In this project, I learnt a lot about the importance and handling of state management in react</p><br/>
        <p>One of the big learnings for me was the different state management methods available for use in react</p><br/>
        <p>I learnt error management, using a loading spinner and much more - THIS WAS FUN AND STRESSFUL... LOL</p><br/>
        <p>Building and deploying the application was also a big learning point for me</p><br/>
        <p>To prevent CORS and mixed content errors, I had to deploy my mock server on vercel</p><br/>
        <p>This application is deployed on firebase</p><br/>
        <p>CLICK <a href="https://shoe-store-mock.web.app" target="_blank">HERE</a> TO BUY YOUR SHOES!&#x1F61C;</p>
        <p>Also, do not be shocked if you keep finding new features for every time you come to it.</p><br/>
        <p>I also built a ci/cd pipeline for it using github workflow</p><br/>
        <p>here is the <a href="https://github.com/Ark-Arch/shoe-store-app" target="_blank">git repo</a></p>

            <h3><a href="https://ark-arch.github.io/react-api-checkpoint" target="_blank">STAFF DETAILS APP</a></h3>
        <p>this was a simple project i spinned up while learning at gomycode institute</p><br/>
        <p>In this project, i used the axios module to fetch data from a jsonplaceholder database</p><br/>
        <p>One of the big learnings for me was implementing the api fetch functions.</p><br/>
        <p>Another was when I styled the app with bootstrap to include a modal for each of the staff/user</p><br/>
        <p>CLICK <a href="https://ark-arch.github.io/react-api-checkpoint" target="_blank">HERE</a> TO HAVE FUN WITH IT!</p>
        <p> I have it deployed on github pages</p>

	    <h3><a href="http://3.95.14.158:4001/login" target="_blank">A NOTES TAKING APP</a></h3>
	<p>A safe place to pen down your thoughts and lessons as you like.</p><br/>
	<p>I built this with the flask web framework, and entirely with the vim editor on a Linux environ.</p><br/>
	<p>One of the big learnings for me was understanding and implementing the idea of authentication and authorization using the flask_login module.</p><br/>
	<p>Another one for me was handling and drawing up the database model. And making and taking advantage of relationships along database tables</p><br/>
	<p>CLICK <a href="http://3.95.14.158:4001/login" target="_blank">HERE</a> TO HAVE FUN WITH IT!</p>

            <p>A very fun game to while away your time!</p><br/>
            <p>left-click to click a non-mine, right-click to predict a mine, click a mine to lose!. survive 9 mines to win!</p><br/>
            <p>I built this with simple python and her built in library -> tkinter; with no frameworks</p><br/>
            <p>This one project took me along the bumps and rides of the concept of Object Oriented Programming!</p><br/>
            <p>I got frustrated at some point! (shhhh!! do not tell! :) )</p><br/>
            <p>It is a desktop application with virtually no dependencies. All it needs is python3 installed on your machine</p><br/>

            <p>This is a react app that simply uses the search function to filter out monsters.</p><br/>
            <p>Clicking on the monsters should show you a bit of description about them. (Although I havenÂ´t fixed that in yet)</p><br/>
            <p>But so far, with this project, I learnt how to think like a react developer</p><br/>
            <p>I also deployed it on my ec2 instance</p><br/>

            <p>This is also a flask web app that simply tells about me - David Agbemuko </p><br/>
            <p>The biggest learnings for me was the css animations I had to think through and debug!.</p><br/>
